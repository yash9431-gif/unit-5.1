          <h2>Hi My name is Yash Raj, I had completed my graduation in Year 2020 in Electronics and Communication from Chandigarh University. I found my passion as a programmer during my college days, where I was introduced to coding for the very first time. As I learned more, I grew even fonder of the subject, deciding to enhance my skills in the field by taking an additional course in Full Stack Web Development through Masai School. I am a person with positive attitude and looking for an opportunity to apply my knowledge in real time work environment and also a great sense to learn new things everyday. </h2>
